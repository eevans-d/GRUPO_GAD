1. ✅ Enabled `release_command` in fly.toml
2. ✅ Removed temporary `ALLOW_NO_DB` flag
3. ✅ Redeployed application
4. ✅ Health checks passing (200 OK)
5. ✅ API responding correctly

## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS

**Why DATABASE_URL was already there:**
- Previous deployment to Railway had configured it
- Secret was migrated to Fly.io
- We just needed to enable the release_command

**Smart Move:**
- Made database optional with `ALLOW_NO_DB` flag
- Allowed us to deploy without immediately finding the DB
- When discovered, could activate migrations without re-engineering

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE

All documentation remains in repo:
- `STATE_OF_REPO.md` - Current status
- `ACTION_PLAN.md` - Three learning paths
- `NEXT_ITERATION.md` - Future phases
- And 9+ more reference docs

- ✅ Live application (Fly.io)
- ✅ PostgreSQL database (configured)
- ✅ Database migrations (enabled)
- ✅ WebSocket system (active)
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS (automatic)
- ✅ Health monitoring (passing)
- ✅ Complete documentation (12 files)
